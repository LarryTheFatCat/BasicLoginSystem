# SwingGUI Rewrite 
- I will be porting everything to here with some modifications.

# Notes
- Due to me fucking up the old one with so many things, I've decided to port most things to here.
- Reason? Because old method looks too complicated and I want to simplify and expand my development.
- Why am I doing this? I like java, it's simple and understandable. Swing is very understandable and
lots of people should be able to read it with my code that I have ported. 

# Features
- Launch page.
- The launch page has a loginButton and registerButton, the register button goes into a new window (that's why there's the NewWindowClass)
and displays the code that should eventually say Username:, Password:, Activation Code:, Register:. Once you click register,
it should pop a text that says: Register Successful. Hopefully in the future I can figure out how to save the preset to a database.


- NewWindow.
- The NewWindow Class is the popUp that shows after you click Register. 


- Main.
- Not fully developed. Soon^TM

So I'm just going to show the Register because I hate the other parts as it's not done and I plan on finishing the most
difficult part first.
