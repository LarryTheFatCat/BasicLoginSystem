# SwingGUI Rewrite
- I stopped working on the old one because I got lazy and forgot everything I did, some parts are partially skidded as well (lol)
- I deleted the old version because I didn't like it.
# Requirements
- Java 15
- Swing isn't hard to understand, I would just recommend using JavaFX, a lot easier and more fun then Swing.
